# Linear_Search_In_C:
## Linear Search in Java.This program demonstrates the Linear Search algorithm in Java. Linear Search is a simple searching technique where each element of the array is checked one by one until the required element is found or the list ends.

## Algorithm
1. Start from the first element of the array.
2. Compare the search element with each element.
3. If a match is found, display the position.
4. If the end of the array is reached and no match is found, display "Element not found".

## Features
- Works on unsorted arrays
- Easy to understand and implement
- Suitable for small data sets

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(n)
